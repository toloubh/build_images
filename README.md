# auto_build_push

In Docker Hub, you have the capability to connect your account to GitHub or Bitbucket. This connection allows you to link your repositories to Docker Hub and utilize features such as automated builds and pushes.

However, to use these features, you need a Pro or Team subscription in Docker Hub, which incurs a cost. But if you're looking for a free way to build and push Docker images, you can use a simple method using YAML files in GitHub Actions.

Using YAML files in GitHub Actions, you can easily define a build and push process for your Docker images. In this method, you can directly use GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images without the need for a Pro or Team subscription in Docker Hub.
